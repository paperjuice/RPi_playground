# RPi_playground

## Description
Raspberry Pi was something that I was interested in working with for some time now. I got myself one among with a GPIO/Motors kit.

For now Python is the language of choice because I can focus on the RPi API(given that Python is so easy to start with) but I would like to transition to C eventually.

## Projects
#### Simple led
Simple circuit composed out of the RPi, two jumper cables, a solderless breadboard, a 220ohm resistor and an 2V LED. I would say this is the `Hello World` of RPi/electronics.

#### Digital counter
Slightly more complex circuit. It uses 13 LEDs, connected in parallel. Every LED uses a 220ohm rezistor.
